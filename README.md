## PasswordGenerator

## Assignment
The assignment was to create a password generator that first prompted the user to select how many characters they'd like to be in their password, followed by a series of confirms that asked what kind of characters (lower case letters, uppercase letter, numbers, or special characters).

## Warning
This is not a safe method of generating a password, just an example on the power of Javascript!
